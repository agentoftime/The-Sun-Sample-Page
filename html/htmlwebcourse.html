			<p>In the center of our solar system, rests the Sun, in which everything in the solar system orbits around. The sun is a star which is essentially a giant ball of burning gas. Our particular star, was born about 4.6 billion years ago and will stay, much as it is today for another 5 billion years. Around this time, our Sun will begin to swell, becoming a red giant. Eventually, it will shed its outer layers and collapse into a white dwarf until it fades into a black dwarf... and then fades from existence all together.</p>

		<h2>A Detailed Look into the Sun's Life Cycle</h2>

			<p>We will follow the Sun's entire life cycle. What we believe happened to create our Star and how it is at present time and then what is yet to come.</p>

				<div class="stages">

					<h3>The Early Stages</h3>

						<p>About 4.6 billion years ago, there was nothing but dust where our solar system currently resides. Something triggered the cloud to collapse and condense and over the next 100,000 years the cloud continued to squeeze tighter and tighter, until the tempature was hot enough to perform nuclear fusion. In this time, the sun was considered a 'protostar', a very early stage in the evolution of stars. Once the tempature was hot enough to perform nuclear fusion, the Sun became a main sequence star.</p>

						<p>If the sun would have failed to reach a tempature hot enough to perform nuclear fusion, it may have been considered a Brown Dwarf. Brown dwarfs are about the size of Jupiter and are incredibly cool stars. Some are so cool, that you could potentially touch its surface, not getting hotter than 80 degrees F. They are considered the missing link between gas giant planets, like Jupiter, and low-mass stars.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="stages">

					<h3>The Main Sequence Stage</h3>

						<p>The sun will be in the stage for about 10 billion years. During the time in which the Sun is in its main sequence stage, nuclear fusion reactions occur in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium, causing the core to shrink, gradually. This adds pressure to the core and the rate in which fusion occurs will increase. This means the Sun's luminosity will increase over time and in 1.1 billion years from now, it will be 10% brighter than it is today. This increase in luminosity, also means an increase in heat, triggering a runaway greenhouse effect on Earth. Eventually, Earth will become another Venus.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="stages">

					<h3>Red Giant Stage</h3>

						<p>In about 5 billion years, the sun will exhaust the hydrogen in its core and the helium will become unstable, collapsing under its own weight. The core will then heat up and gen denser, causing the Sun to grow in size. It will then be considered a Red Giant. Mercury and Venus will be engulfed by the Red Giant but it is uncertain if Earth will be or will be spared. Even if Earth is spared, it will be a dry, uninhabitable rock. The Sun will only remain a Red Giant for 100 million years or so.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="stages">

					<h3>The Final Stage</h3>

						<p>The Sun will shrink and expel it's outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. At this point, it will not be much bigger than Earth is today and will be classified as a White Dwarf. After billions of more years, it will fade into a Black Dwarf and then fade into nothing.</p>

						<p>Our Sun is not massive enough to go out with a bang, so instead it will fade until it is no more. Black dwarfs are theoretical, as not enough time has passed for a White Dwarf, in all of the observable universe, to fade.</p>
